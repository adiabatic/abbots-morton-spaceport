  # units_per_em: The number of font units per em square.
  #
  # 1000 is the standard value for CFF-based OpenType fonts. It provides
  # good precision for defining glyph outlines while keeping coordinate
  # values manageable. TrueType fonts often use 2048, but 1000 is the
  # convention for PostScript/CFF and works well with our pixel-based
  # approach since it divides evenly into nice pixel sizes.
  units_per_em: 1000

  # pixel_size: The size of one pixel in font units.
  #
  # Since the source font is 18pt and we want roughly 18 pixels to fit
  # within the em square vertically, we calculate: 1000 / 18 ≈ 55.6,
  # rounded to 56. This means each "pixel" in our bitmap definitions
  # becomes a 56x56 unit square in the font. The slight rounding means
  # we get approximately 17.9 pixels per em (1000/56), which is close
  # enough to 18 for our purposes and gives us a clean integer to work
  # with throughout the build process.
  pixel_size: 56

  # ascender: The distance from the baseline to the top of the tallest
  # glyphs, in font units.
  #
  # 784 = 14 × 56, meaning 14 pixels above the baseline. This covers
  # the tallest characters in the font. Most uppercase letters like 'A'
  # have bitmaps around 13-14 rows tall. Setting the ascender to 14
  # pixels provides enough headroom for the tallest glyphs plus any
  # combining marks that sit above them (like accents, which use
  # y_offset to position themselves even higher).
  ascender: 784

  # descender: The distance from the baseline to the bottom of glyphs
  # with descenders, in font units (negative because it's below baseline).
  #
  # -224 = -4 × 56, meaning 4 pixels below the baseline. Characters
  # with descenders like 'g', 'y', 'p', 'q', and 'Q' extend below the
  # baseline. Looking at 'g' (y_offset: -2, 6 rows) and 'Q' (y_offset:
  # -2, 11 rows), the lowest point reaches about 2 pixels below baseline.
  # Setting descender to -4 pixels provides comfortable margin and room
  # for any bottom-attaching marks like cedillas or ogoneks.
  descender: -224

  # cap_height: The height of uppercase letters, in font units.
  #
  # 672 = 12 × 56, meaning uppercase letters are 12 pixels tall. This
  # is measured from the baseline to the top of flat uppercase letters
  # like 'H' or 'E'. Looking at the 'A' glyph: it has 14 bitmap rows
  # with y_offset: -1, so its top pixel sits at y = 12 (calculated as
  # -1 + 14 - 1 = 12 pixels). The cap_height informs text layout
  # engines where the tops of capital letters sit, useful for optical
  # alignment and vertical centering.
  cap_height: 672

  # x_height: The height of lowercase letters without ascenders or
  # descenders, in font units.
  #
  # 448 = 8 × 56, meaning the main body of lowercase letters is 8
  # pixels tall. This is measured from the baseline to the top of
  # flat lowercase letters like 'x', 'e', or 'a' (excluding any parts
  # that rise above, like the ascender on 'b' or 'd'). The x_height
  # is important for readability metrics and helps applications make
  # decisions about font scaling and line spacing. At 8 pixels, it's
  # roughly 2/3 of the cap_height, which is typical for Latin fonts.
  x_height: 448
