# Fontlog for Abbots Morton Spaceport

Much of what goes in a FONTLOG file — other than the changelog — is in the README.

## Changelog

### 6.000

#### Generally

- Completely change the Sans-variant font name by adding “Junior” to the end of “Abbots Morton Spaceport Sans”; this means the old filename is gone

#### Latin letters

- Add kerning so short letters after `f` are tucked in more
- Add kerning so just about everything before a `j` is tucked in more closely

#### Quikscript

- Add enough sans-serif glyphs to have a full-featured font
- Add an alpha-quality very-incomplete proof-of-concepts (yes, plural) Quikscript Senior version of the font with enough ligations (using OpenType’s `curs`) and contextual alternates (·Roe glyphs with an extra-long tail at the top/bottom) and ligatures (·Day·Eat, ·Day·Utter)

### 5.000

- Un-swap ·Oy and ·Out

### 4.000

- Center glyphs within their advance width to match Departure Mono’s metrics
